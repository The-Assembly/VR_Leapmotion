# Go Controller-Free in VR With Gesture Tracking

## Introduction to Today's Workshop
In this workshop, we’ll show you how you can ditch the controller altogether and use simple hand gestures to control VR experiences directly with the help of a headset-mounted Leap Motion sensor. We’ll guide you on how to code in Unity to achieve this and implement various scenarios to test out this functionality.
